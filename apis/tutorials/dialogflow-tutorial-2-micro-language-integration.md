# Dialogflow Tutorial 2 - Micro language integration

We'll start from Dialogflow Tutorial 1, just adding a small library to our original endpoint.

Follow all the steps in Tutorial 1 but stop to deploy and run the project on Heroku.

You must use the code in Tutorial 1, available on Github [here](https://github.com/Tiledesk/tiledesk-dialogflow-proxy-tutorial).

This time we'll give a try the second end point already embedded into the nodeJS app.
