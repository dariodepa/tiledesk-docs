# Dialogflow Tutorial 2 - Buttons and images

We'll start from Dialogflow Tutorial 1, just adding a small library to our original endpoint.

Follow all the steps in Tutorial 1 but stop to deploy and run the project on Heroku.

## Fork the tutorial code

You must use the code in Tutorial 1. The code is available on Github [here](https://github.com/Tiledesk/tiledesk-dialogflow-proxy-tutorial).

**Fork the tutorial** code using the Fork button. Now you have a copy of the tutorial on your own repo.

## Step 1

This time we'll give a try to the second end point already embedded into the nodeJS app: **/microlang-bot**

First we need to create a Dialogflow agent. Then we can just focus on the defaultWelcomeIntent to show how buttons and images work. This same logic also applies to every other intent in the Dialogflow agent.
