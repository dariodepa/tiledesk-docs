As highlighted in the popup you **must securely save** the file on your computer and never publish it online \(for example **never push this file on public Github repos**\).

In some Tiledesk tutorials or in documentation you will be sometimes asked to have this file on hand, so please refer to this tutorial to generate a new one when needed.

Enjoy!
